# SpinUp322A
This is the code base for Vex Robotics Team 322A for the Spin Up robotics season.
This code implements a basic x, y odometry coordinate system in order to control the motion of the robot on the field.
Also includes sensor based object detection in order to reduce manual inputs as much as possible.
